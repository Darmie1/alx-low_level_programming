DYNAMIC LIBRARY


A dynamic library is a separate binary file containing reusable code that can be loaded into memory and linked with programs at runtime. It allows for efficient sharing of code among multiple programs and provides benefits in terms of memory usage, maintenance, and updates.

Compilation:

Dynamic libraries are compiled separately from the programs that use them. This results in a shared library file (e.g., a .dll file on Windows or a .so file on Unix-like systems).

Note that dynamic library is also known as shared library, it remain separate from the executable.
