This directory contains malloc files.

malloc is a standard library function in C that is used for dynamic memory allocation. It stands for "memory allocation." The malloc function is declared in the <stdlib.h> header file.
malloc in c allows us to allocate memory for data structures, arrays, and other variables as needed, rather than statically allocating memory at compile time.
