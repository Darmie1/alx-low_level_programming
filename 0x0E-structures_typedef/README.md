STRUCTURES AND TYPEDEF


Structures in C allow you to group related data items of different types into a single unit. It allows you to define your own custom data type that can hold multiple variables with different data types. A structure is defined using the struct keyword, followed by the structure name and a block of member declarations enclosed in curly braces

C allows you to use the typedef keyword to create an alias or a new name for an existing data type. With typedef, you can define a new name for a structure type, which simplifies the declaration and makes the code more readable.

The general rule with the use of typedef is to write out a declaration as if you were declaring variables of the types that you want. Where a declaration would have introduced names with particular types, prefixing the whole thing with typedef means that, instead of getting variables declared, you declare new type names instead. Those new type names can then be used as the prefix to the declaration of variables of the new type.



The requirement for this project allows only few  C standard library functions which include printf, malloc, free and exit.
